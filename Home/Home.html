        <p class="pragraph"><b>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound
                system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly
                or
                indirectly. Of the objects that orbit the Sun directly, the
                largest are the eight planets, with the remainder being
                smaller objects, the dwarf planets and small Solar System
                bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly—the
                natural satellites—two are larger than the smallest planet,
                Mercury.
                The Solar System formed 4.6 billion years ago from the
                gravitational collapseof a giant interstellar molecular cloud.
                The vast majority of the system's massis in the Sun, with the
                majority of the remaining mass contained in Jupiter. The
                four smaller inner planets, Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars,
                areterrestrial planets, being primarily composed of rock and
                metal. The four outer planets are giant planets, being
                substantially more massive than the terrestrials. The two
                largest
                planets, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed
                mainly of hydrogen and helium; the two outermost
                planets,Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed
                mostly of substances with relatively high melting points
                compared with hydrogen and helium, called volatiles, such as
                water, ammonia and methane. All eight planets have almost
                circular orbits that lie within a nearly flat disc called the
                ecliptic.
                The Solar System also contains smaller objects. The asteroid
                belt, which lies between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter,
                mostly contains objects composed, like the terrestrial planets,
                of rock and metal. Beyond Neptune's orbit lie the Kuiper
                belt and scattered disc, which are populations of
                trans-Neptunian objects composed mostly of ices, and beyond them
                a
                newly discovered population of sednoids. Within these
                populations, some objects are large enough to have rounded under
                their own gravity, though there is considerable debate as to how
                many there will prove to be. Such objects are
                categorized as dwarf planets. The only certain dwarf planet
                isPluto, with another trans-Neptunian object, Eris, expected
                to be, and the asteroid Ceres at least close to being a dwarf
                planet. In addition to these two regions, various other
                small-body populations, including comets,centaurs and
                interplanetary dust clouds, freely travel between regions. Six
                of
                the planets, the six largest possible dwarf planets, and many of
                the smaller bodies are orbited by natural satellites,
                usually termed "moons" after theMoon. Each of the outer planets
                is encircled by planetary rings of dust and other small
                objects.
                The solar wind, a stream of charged particles flowing outwards
                from the Sun, creates a bubble-like region in the
                interstellar medium known as theheliosphere. The heliopause is
                the point at which pressure from the solar wind is equal
                to the opposing pressure of the interstellar medium; it extends
                out to the edge of the scattered disc. The Oort cloud,
                which is thought to be the source for long-period comets, may
                also exist at a distance roughly a thousand times further
                than the heliosphere. The Solar System is located in the Orion
                Arm, 26,000 light-years from the center of the Milky Way
                galaxy</b></p>
