        <p class="pragraph"><b>A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star
                or stellar remnant that is massive enough to be rounded by its
                own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear
                fusion, and – according to the International Astronomical Union
                but not all planetary scientists – has cleared its neighbouring
                region of planetesimals.

                The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology,
                science, mythology, and religion. Apart from Earth itself, five
                planets in the Solar System are often visible to the naked eye.
                These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as
                emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human
                perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of
                disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union
                (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within
                the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it
                excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what
                they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered
                before 1950 remain "planets" under the current definition, some
                celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an
                object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first
                trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered
                planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as
                planets under the current definition of planet.

                The planets were thought by Ptolemy to orbit Earth in deferent
                and epicycle motions. Although the idea that the planets orbited
                the Sun had been suggested many times, it was not until the 17th
                century that this view was supported by evidence from the first
                telescopic astronomical observations, performed by Galileo
                Galilei. About the same time, by careful analysis of
                pre-telescopic observational data collected by Tycho Brahe,
                Johannes Kepler found the planets' orbits were elliptical rather
                than circular. As observational tools improved, astronomers saw
                that, like Earth, each of the planets rotated around an axis
                tilted with respect to its orbital pole, and some shared such
                features as ice caps and seasons. Since the dawn of the Space
                Age, close observation by space probes has found that Earth and
                the other planets share characteristics such as volcanism,
                hurricanes, tectonics, and even hydrology.

                Planets in the Solar System are divided into two main types:
                large low-density giant planets, and smaller rocky terrestrials.
                There are eight planets in the Solar System according to the IAU
                definition. In order of increasing distance from the Sun, they
                are the four terrestrials, Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, then
                the four giant planets, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
                Six of the planets are orbited by one or more natural
                satellites, the two exceptions being Mercury and Venus.

                Several thousands of planets around other stars ("extrasolar
                planets" or "exoplanets") have been discovered in the Milky Way.
                As of 22 June 2021, 4,768 known extrasolar planets in 3,527
                planetary systems (including 783 multiple planetary systems),
                ranging in size from just above the size of the Moon to gas
                giants about twice as large as Jupiter, have been discovered,
                out of which more than 100 planets are the same size as Earth,
                nine of which are at the same relative distance from their star
                as Earth from the Sun, i.e. in the circumstellar habitable zone.
                On 20 December 2011, the Kepler Space Telescope team reported
                the discovery of the first Earth-sized extrasolar planets,
                Kepler-20e and Kepler-20f, orbiting a Sun-like star, Kepler-20.
                A 2012 study, analyzing gravitational microlensing data,
                estimates an average of at least 1.6 bound planets for every
                star in the Milky Way. Around one in five Sun-like stars is
                thought to have an Earth-sized planet in its habitable zone.</b></p>
