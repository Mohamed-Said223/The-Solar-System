        <p class="addres">Venus</p>
        <p class="pragraph"><b>Venus is the second planet from the Sun. It is
                named after the Roman goddess of love and
                beauty. As the brightest natural object in Earth's night sky
                after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can
                be, on rare occasions, visible to the naked eye in broad
                daylight. Venus lies within Earth's orbit,
                and so never appears to venture far from the Sun, either setting
                in the west just after dusk or rising in
                the east a little while before dawn. Venus orbits the Sun every
                224.7 Earth days. It has a synodic day
                length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243
                Earth days. As a consequence, it takes longer
                to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar
                System, and does so in the opposite direction to
                all but Uranus. This means the Sun rises in the west and sets in
                the east. Venus does not have any
                moons, a distinction it shares only with Mercury among the
                planets in the Solar System.

                Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's
                "sister planet" because of their similar size,
                mass, proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is
                radically different from Earth in other respects. It
                has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets,
                consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The
                atmospheric pressure at the planet's surface is about 92 times
                the sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly
                the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even
                though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus has
                the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System, with a
                mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F).
                Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds
                of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface
                from being seen from space in visible light. It may have had
                water oceans in the past, but these
                would have vaporized as the temperature rose due to a runaway
                greenhouse effect. The water has probably
                photodissociated, and the free hydrogen has been swept into
                interplanetary space by the solar wind because
                of the lack of a planetary magnetic field.

                As one of the brightest objects in the sky, Venus has been a
                major fixture in human culture for as long as
                records have existed. It has been made sacred to gods of many
                cultures, and has been a prime inspiration for
                writers and poets as the "morning star" and "evening star".
                Venus was the first planet to have its motions
                plotted across the sky, as early as the second millennium
                BC.

                Due to its proximity to Earth, Venus has been a prime target for
                early interplanetary exploration. It was
                the first planet beyond Earth visited by a spacecraft (Mariner 2
                in 1962), and the first to be successfully
                landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venus's thick clouds render
                observation of its surface impossible in
                visible light, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until
                the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991.
                Plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions,
                but they are hindered by Venus's hostile
                surface conditions. The possibility of life on Venus has long
                been a topic of speculation, and in recent
                years has received active research.</b></p>
