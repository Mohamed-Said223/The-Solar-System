        <p class="addres">Jupiter</p>
        <p class="pragraph"><b>Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the
                largest in the Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass more
                than two and a half times that of all the other planets in the
                Solar System combined, but slightly less than one-thousandth the
                mass of the Sun. Jupiter is the third-brightest natural object
                in the Earth's night sky after the Moon and Venus. It has been
                observed since pre-historic times and is named after the Roman
                god Jupiter, the king of the gods, because of its observed size.
                Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen, but helium comprises
                one quarter of its mass and one tenth of its volume. It likely
                has a rocky core of heavier elements, but like the other
                giant planets, Jupiter lacks a well-defined solid surface. The
                on-going contraction of its interior generates heat greater than
                the amount received from the Sun. Because of its rapid rotation,
                the planet's shape is that of an oblate spheroid; it has a
                slight but noticeable bulge around the equator. The outer
                atmosphere is visibly segregated into several bands at different
                latitudes, with turbulence and storms along their interacting
                boundaries. A prominent result of this is the Great Red Spot, a
                giant storm that is known to have existed since at least the
                17th century, when it was first seen by telescope.

                Surrounding Jupiter is a faint planetary ring system and a
                powerful magnetosphere. Jupiter's magnetic tail is nearly 800
                million km long, covering the entire distance to Saturn's orbit.
                Jupiter has almost a hundred known moons and possibly many
                more, including the four large Galilean moons discovered by
                Galileo Galilei in 1610. Ganymede, the largest of these, has a
                diameter greater than that of the planet Mercury.

                Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to visit Jupiter, making its
                closest approach to the planet in December 1973. Jupiter has
                since been explored on a number of occasions by robotic
                spacecraft, beginning with the Pioneer and Voyager flyby
                missions from 1973 to 1979, and later by the Galileo orbiter,
                which arrived at Jupiter in 1995. In 2007, Jupiter was
                visited by the New Horizons probe, which used Jupiter's gravity
                to increase its speed and bend its trajectory en route to Pluto.
                The latest probe to visit the planet, Juno, entered orbit around
                Jupiter in July 2016. Future targets for exploration in
                the Jupiter system include the probable ice-covered liquid ocean
                of the moon Europa.</b></p>
