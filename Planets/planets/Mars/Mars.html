        <p class="addres">Mars</p>
        <p class="pragraph"><b>Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the
                second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being larger than
                only Mercury. In English, Mars carries the name of the Roman god
                of war and is often referred to as the "Red Planet". The
                latter refers to the effect of the iron oxide prevalent on
                Mars's surface, which gives it a reddish appearance distinctive
                among the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye. Mars
                is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, with surface
                features reminiscent of the impact craters of the Moon and the
                valleys, deserts and polar ice caps of Earth.

                The days and seasons are comparable to those of Earth, because
                the rotational period as well as the tilt of the rotational axis
                relative to the ecliptic plane are similar. Mars is the site of
                Olympus Mons, the largest volcano and highest known mountain on
                any planet in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, one of
                the largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth Borealis
                basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and
                may be a giant impact feature. Mars has two moons,
                Phobos and Deimos, which are small and irregularly shaped. These
                may be captured asteroids, similar to 5261 Eureka, a Mars
                trojan.

                Mars has been explored by several uncrewed spacecraft. Mariner 4
                was the first spacecraft to visit Mars; launched by NASA on 28
                November 1964, it made its closest approach to the planet on 15
                July 1965. Mariner 4 detected the weak Martian radiation belt,
                measured at about 0.1% that of Earth, and captured the first
                images of another planet from deep space. The Soviet Mars 3
                mission included a lander, which achieved a soft landing in
                December 1971; however, contact was lost seconds after
                touchdown. On 20 July 1976, Viking 1 performed the first
                successful landing on the Martian surface. On 4 July 1997,
                the Mars Pathfinder spacecraft landed on Mars and on 5 July
                released its rover, Sojourner, the first robotic rover to
                operate on Mars. The Mars Express orbiter, the first
                European Space Agency (ESA) spacecraft to visit Mars, arrived in
                orbit on 25 December 2003. In January 2004, NASA's Mars
                Exploration Rovers, named Spirit and Opportunity, both landed on
                Mars; Spirit operated until 22 March 2010 and Opportunity lasted
                until 10 June 2018. NASA landed its Curiosity rover on
                August 6, 2012, as a part of its Mars Science Laboratory (MSL)
                mission to investigate Martian climate and geology. On 24
                September 2014, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO)
                became the fourth space agency to visit Mars when its maiden
                interplanetary mission, the Mars Orbiter Mission spacecraft,
                arrived in orbit. The United Arab Emirates became the fifth
                to successfully undertake a mission to Mars, having inserted an
                orbiter into the Martian atmosphere on 9 February 2021.
                China National Space Administration (CNSA)'s Tianwen-1
                spacecraft arrived in Martian orbit on 10 February 2021.
                NASA's Perseverance rover and Ingenuity helicopter successfully
                landed on Mars on 18 February 2021. Ingenuity successfully
                completed the first powered controlled flight by an aircraft on
                any planet besides Earth on 19 April 2021, taking off
                vertically, hovering and landing on Mars. On 14 May
                2021, CNSA's Tianwen-1 lander and Zhurong rover successfully
                landed on Mars. Zhurong rover was successfully deployed on
                22 May 2021, which makes China the second country to
                successfully deploy a rover on Mars, after the United
                States.

                There are investigations assessing the past habitability of
                Mars, as well as the possibility of extant life. Astrobiology
                missions are planned, such as the European Space Agency's
                Rosalind Franklin rover. Liquid water on the
                surface of Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure,
                which is less than 1% of the atmospheric pressure on Earth,
                except at the lowest elevations for short periods.
                The two polar ice caps appear to be made largely of
                water. The volume of water ice in the south polar ice
                cap, if melted, would be sufficient to cover the planetary
                surface to a depth of 11 metres (36 ft). In November 2016,
                NASA reported finding a large amount of underground ice in the
                Utopia Planitia region. The volume of water detected has been
                estimated to be equivalent to the volume of water in Lake
                Superior.

                Mars can easily be seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can
                its reddish coloring. Its apparent magnitude reaches −2.94,
                which is surpassed only by Venus, the Moon and the Sun.
                Optical ground-based telescopes are typically limited to
                resolving features about 300 kilometres (190 mi) across when
                Earth and Mars are closest because of Earth's atmosphere.</b></p>
