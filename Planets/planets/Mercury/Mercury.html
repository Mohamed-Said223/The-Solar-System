        <p class="addres">Mercury</p>
        <p class="pragraph"><b>Mercury is the smallest planet in the Solar
                System and the closest to the Sun. Its orbit around the Sun
                takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.
                It is named after the Roman god Mercurius (Mercury), god of
                commerce, messenger of the gods, and mediator between gods and
                mortals, corresponding to the Greek god Hermes (Ἑρμῆς). Like
                Venus, Mercury orbits the Sun within Earth's orbit as an
                inferior planet, and its apparent distance from the Sun as
                viewed from Earth never exceeds 28°. This proximity to the Sun
                means the planet can only be seen near the western horizon after
                sunset or the eastern horizon before sunrise, usually in
                twilight. At this time, it may appear as a bright star-like
                object but is often far more difficult to observe than Venus.
                From Earth, the planet telescopically displays the complete
                range of phases, similar to Venus and the Moon, which recurs
                over its synodic period of approximately 116 days.

                Mercury rotates in a way that is unique in the Solar System. It
                is tidally locked with the Sun in a 3:2 spin–orbit resonance,
                meaning that relative to the fixed stars, it rotates on its axis
                exactly three times for every two revolutions it makes around
                the Sun. As seen from the Sun, in a frame of reference that
                rotates with the orbital motion, it appears to rotate only once
                every two Mercurian years. An observer on Mercury would
                therefore see only one day every two Mercurian years.

                Mercury's axis has the smallest tilt of any of the Solar
                System's planets (about 1⁄30 degree). Its orbital eccentricity
                is the largest of all known planets in the Solar System; at
                perihelion, Mercury's distance from the Sun is only about
                two-thirds (or 66%) of its distance at aphelion. Mercury's
                surface appears heavily cratered and is similar in appearance to
                the Moon's, indicating that it has been geologically inactive
                for billions of years. Having almost no atmosphere to retain
                heat, it has surface temperatures that vary diurnally more than
                on any other planet in the Solar System, ranging from 100 K
                (−173 °C; −280 °F) at night to 700 K (427 °C; 800 °F) during the
                day across the equatorial regions. The polar regions are
                constantly below 180 K (−93 °C; −136 °F). The planet has no
                known natural satellites.

                Two spacecraft have visited Mercury: Mariner 10 flew by in 1974
                and 1975; and MESSENGER, launched in 2004, orbited Mercury over
                4,000 times in four years before exhausting its fuel and
                crashing into the planet's surface on April 30, 2015. The
                BepiColombo spacecraft is planned to arrive at Mercury in 2025.</b></p>
