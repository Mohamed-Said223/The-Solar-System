        <p class="addres">Neptune</p>
        <p class="pragraph"><b>Neptune is the eighth and farthest-known Solar
                planet from the Sun. In the Solar System, it is the
                fourth-largest planet by diameter, the third-most-massive
                planet, and the densest giant planet. It is 17 times the mass of
                Earth, slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Neptune
                is denser and physically smaller than Uranus because its greater
                mass causes more gravitational compression of its atmosphere.
                The planet orbits the Sun once every 164.8 years at an average
                distance of 30.1 AU (4.5 billion km; 2.8 billion mi). It is
                named after the Roman god of the sea and has the astronomical
                symbol ♆, a stylised version of the god Neptune's trident.
                Neptune is not visible to the unaided eye and is the only planet
                in the Solar System found by mathematical prediction rather than
                by empirical observation. Unexpected changes in the orbit of
                Uranus led Alexis Bouvard to deduce that its orbit was subject
                to gravitational perturbation by an unknown planet. After
                Bouvard's death, the position of Neptune was predicted from his
                observations, independently, by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le
                Verrier. Neptune was subsequently observed with a telescope on
                23 September 1846 by Johann Galle within a degree of the
                position predicted by Le Verrier. Its largest moon, Triton, was
                discovered shortly thereafter, though none of the planet's
                remaining 13 known moons were located telescopically until the
                20th century. The planet's distance from Earth gives it a very
                small apparent size, making it challenging to study with
                Earth-based telescopes. Neptune was visited by Voyager 2, when
                it flew by the planet on 25 August 1989; Voyager 2 remains the
                only spacecraft to visit Neptune. The advent of the
                Hubble Space Telescope and large ground-based telescopes with
                adaptive optics has recently allowed for additional detailed
                observations from afar.

                Like Jupiter and Saturn, Neptune's atmosphere is composed
                primarily of hydrogen and helium, along with traces of
                hydrocarbons and possibly nitrogen, though it contains a higher
                proportion of "ices" such as water, ammonia and methane.
                However, similar to Uranus, its interior is primarily composed
                of ices and rock; Uranus and Neptune are normally considered
                "ice giants" to emphasise this distinction. Traces of
                methane in the outermost regions in part account for the
                planet's blue appearance, though an unknown component is
                believed to color Neptune a deeper blue compared to Uranus.
                In contrast to the hazy, relatively featureless atmosphere of
                Uranus, Neptune's atmosphere has active and visible weather
                patterns. For example, at the time of the Voyager 2 flyby in
                1989, the planet's southern hemisphere had a Great Dark Spot
                comparable to the Great Red Spot on Jupiter. More recently, in
                2018, a newer main dark spot and smaller dark spot were
                identified and studied. In addition, these weather patterns
                are driven by the strongest sustained winds of any planet in the
                Solar System, with recorded wind speeds as high as 2,100 km/h
                (580 m/s; 1,300 mph). Because of its great distance from the
                Sun, Neptune's outer atmosphere is one of the coldest places in
                the Solar System, with temperatures at its cloud tops
                approaching 55 K (−218 °C; −361 °F). Temperatures at the
                planet's centre are approximately 5,400 K (5,100 °C; 9,300
                °F). Neptune has a faint and fragmented ring system
                (labelled "arcs"), which was discovered in 1984, then later
                confirmed by Voyager 2.</b></p>
