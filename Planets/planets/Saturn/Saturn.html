        <p class="pragraph"><b>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the
                second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. It is a gas
                giant with an average radius of about nine and a half times that
                of Earth. It only has one-eighth the average density of
                Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times
                more massive. Saturn is named after the Roman god of
                wealth and agriculture; its astronomical symbol (♄) represents
                the god's sickle. The Romans named the seventh day of the week
                Saturday, Sāturni diēs ("Saturn's Day") no later than the 2nd
                century for the planet Saturn.

                Saturn's interior is most likely composed of a core of
                iron–nickel and rock (silicon and oxygen compounds). Its core is
                surrounded by a deep layer of metallic hydrogen, an intermediate
                layer of liquid hydrogen and liquid helium, and finally a
                gaseous outer layer. Saturn has a pale yellow hue due to ammonia
                crystals in its upper atmosphere. An electrical current within
                the metallic hydrogen layer is thought to give rise to Saturn's
                planetary magnetic field, which is weaker than the Earth's, but
                which has a magnetic moment 580 times that of Earth due to
                Saturn's larger size. Saturn's magnetic field strength is around
                one-twentieth of Jupiter's. The outer atmosphere is
                generally bland and lacking in contrast, although long-lived
                features can appear. Wind speeds on Saturn can reach 1,800 km/h
                (1,100 mph; 500 m/s), higher than on Jupiter but not as high as
                on Neptune.

                The planet's most famous feature is its prominent ring system,
                which is composed mostly of ice particles, with a smaller amount
                of rocky debris and dust. At least 82 moons are known to
                orbit Saturn, of which 53 are officially named; this does not
                include the hundreds of moonlets in its rings. Titan, Saturn's
                largest moon and the second largest in the Solar System, is
                larger than the planet Mercury, although less massive, and is
                the only moon in the Solar System to have a substantial
                atmosphere.</b></p>
