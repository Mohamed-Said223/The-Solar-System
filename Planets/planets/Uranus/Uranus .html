        <p class="addres">Uranus</p>
        <p class="pragraph"><b>Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. Its
                name is a reference to the Greek god of the sky, Uranus, who,
                according to Greek mythology, was the great-grandfather of Ares
                (Mars), grandfather of Zeus (Jupiter) and father of Cronus
                (Saturn). It has the third-largest planetary radius and
                fourth-largest planetary mass in the Solar System. Uranus is
                similar in composition to Neptune, and both have bulk chemical
                compositions which differ from that of the larger gas giants
                Jupiter and Saturn. For this reason, scientists often classify
                Uranus and Neptune as "ice giants" to distinguish them from the
                other giant planets. Uranus's atmosphere is similar to Jupiter's
                and Saturn's in its primary composition of hydrogen and helium,
                but it contains more "ices" such as water, ammonia, and methane,
                along with traces of other hydrocarbons. It has the coldest
                planetary atmosphere in the Solar System, with a minimum
                temperature of 49 K (−224 °C; −371 °F), and has a complex,
                layered cloud structure with water thought to make up the lowest
                clouds and methane the uppermost layer of clouds. The
                interior of Uranus is mainly composed of ices and rock.

                Like the other giant planets, Uranus has a ring system, a
                magnetosphere, and numerous moons. The Uranian system has a
                unique configuration because its axis of rotation is tilted
                sideways, nearly into the plane of its solar orbit. Its north
                and south poles, therefore, lie where most other planets have
                their equators. In 1986, images from Voyager 2 showed Uranus
                as an almost featureless planet in visible light, without the
                cloud bands or storms associated with the other giant
                planets. Voyager 2 remains the only spacecraft to visit the
                planet. Observations from Earth have shown seasonal change
                and increased weather activity as Uranus approached its equinox
                in 2007. Wind speeds can reach 250 metres per second (900 km/h;
                560 mph).</b></p>
