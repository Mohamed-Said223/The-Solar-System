        <p class="pragraph"><b>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the
                only astronomical object known to harbor and support life. About
                29.2% of Earth's surface is land consisting of continents and
                islands. The remaining 70.8% is covered with water, mostly by
                oceans, seas, gulfs, and other salt-water bodies, but also by
                lakes, rivers, and other freshwater, which together constitute
                the hydrosphere. Much of Earth's polar regions are covered in
                ice. Earth's outer layer is divided into several rigid tectonic
                plates that migrate across the surface over many millions of
                years, while its interior remains active with a solid iron inner
                core, a liquid outer core that generates Earth's magnetic field,
                and a convective mantle that drives plate tectonics.

                Earth's atmosphere consists mostly of nitrogen and oxygen. More
                solar energy is received by tropical regions than polar regions
                and is redistributed by atmospheric and ocean circulation.
                Greenhouse gases also play an important role in regulating the
                surface temperature. A region's climate is not only determined
                by latitude, but also by elevation and proximity to moderating
                oceans, among other factors. Severe weather, such as tropical
                cyclones, thunderstorms, and heatwaves, occurs in most areas and
                greatly impacts life.

                Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space,
                especially the Moon, which is Earth's only natural satellite.
                Earth orbits around the Sun in about 365.25 days. Earth's axis
                of rotation is tilted with respect to its orbital plane,
                producing seasons on Earth. The gravitational interaction
                between Earth and the Moon causes tides, stabilizes Earth's
                orientation on its axis, and gradually slows its rotation. Earth
                is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest and
                most massive of the four rocky planets.

                According to radiometric dating estimation and other evidence,
                Earth formed over 4.5 billion years ago. Within the first
                billion years of Earth's history, life appeared in the oceans
                and began to affect Earth's atmosphere and surface, leading to
                the proliferation of anaerobic and, later, aerobic organisms.
                Some geological evidence indicates that life may have arisen as
                early as 4.1 billion years ago. Since then, the combination of
                Earth's distance from the Sun, physical properties, and
                geological history have allowed life to evolve and thrive. In
                the history of life on Earth, biodiversity has gone through long
                periods of expansion, occasionally punctuated by mass
                extinctions. Over 99% of all species that ever lived on Earth
                are extinct. Almost 8 billion humans live on Earth and depend on
                its biosphere and natural resources for their survival. Humans
                increasingly impact Earth's surface, hydrology, atmospheric
                processes, and other life.</b></p>
