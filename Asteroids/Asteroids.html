        <p class="pragraph"><b>An asteroid is a minor planet of the inner Solar
                System. Historically, these terms have been applied to any
                astronomical object orbiting the Sun that did not resolve into a
                disc in a telescope and was not observed to have characteristics
                of an active comet such as a tail. As minor planets in the outer
                Solar System were discovered that were found to have
                volatile-rich surfaces similar to comets, these came to be
                distinguished from the objects found in the main asteroid
                belt. The term "asteroid" refers to the minor planets of the
                inner Solar System, including those co-orbital with Jupiter.
                Larger asteroids are often called planetoids.</b></p>

                <h2>Comet</h2>
                <p>A comet is an icy, small Solar System body that, when passing
                    close to the Sun, warms and begins to release gases, a
                    process that is called outgassing. This produces a visible
                    atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These
                    phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the
                    solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet
                    nuclei range from a few hundred meters to tens of kilometers
                    across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust,
                    and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times
                    Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch beyond one
                    astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright,</p>

                <p>A meteoroid is a small rocky or metallic
                    body in outer space.

                    Meteoroids are significantly smaller than asteroids, and
                    range in size from small grains to one-meter-wide
                    objects. Objects smaller than this are classified as
                    micrometeoroids or space dust. Most are fragments
                    from comets or asteroids, whereas others are collision
                    impact debris ejected from bodies such as the Moon or Mars.</p>
